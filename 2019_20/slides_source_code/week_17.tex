\textbf{State-based armed conflict}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Intrastate (within)
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[--] With foreign involvement (internationalized)
	\end{itemize}
\item Interstate (between)
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[--] Extrastate
	\end{itemize}
\item At least one actor is the government
\item Incompatibility
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[--] Government
	\item[--] Territory
	\end{itemize}
\item Use of armed force between the TWO parties \ldots
\item \ldots at least 25 battle-related deaths in a year
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Non-state violence}: violent conflict between non-state actors

\textbf{One-sided violence}: targeted killing of civilians (by the state or non-state actors)

\begin{itemize}
\item Pinker's argument: decline in violence. Why? \pause
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item The state as a peace keeper
	\item Trade and economic interdependence
	\item Feminisation and female political participation
	\item Cosmopolitanism
	\item Education, norms, spread of reason
	\end{enumerate} \pause
\item Criticism: has there been such a decline, though? \pause
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Western-centric argument (data, authors)
	\item Many wars (WWI, WWII, \nth{18} and \nth{19} century) waged by states, often for commerce
	\item Cultural and material/institutional factors are entangled
	\item Change time scale or statistics: Data tell different stories
	\item What about geographical distribution of conflict?
	\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\item Can you identify some patterns? \pause
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[--] Is there an actor that is active in several conflicts? 
	\item[--] What type of conflict is most common? Intra or inter-state?
	\item[--] In which region do most conflicts take place?
	\item[--] What are most conflicts about?
